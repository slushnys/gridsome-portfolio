## Technology stack

The company had a technology stack that mainly contained python for the backend and javascript for the frontend.

### Backend

Django has been used for the most part of the application in a monolith kind architecture being served through AWS. RabbitMQ has been used for message queues and Redis has been a cache server.

These services were dockerized on individual containers for local development and were interconnected.

We used Flask to simulate shop API servers in order to achieve fluent process for integration testing.

### Frontend

SendCloud frontend has been written in angular.js the moment when I started working with them, however after some time there was a decision made to shift the frontend stack to vue.js as it started to catch some more and more attention. We then started rewriting single components into Vue piece by piece.

## What have we been working on at sendcloud

SendCloud being the best shipping tool is helping their customers to excel their shipping capabilities throughout Europe and abroad to the international markets saving them money, time and effort.

As a full-stack software developer I worked in a team of great developers with whom we helped SendCloud to reach the peak of technology and innovation within the field of Logistics, Supply Chain and e-commerce.

During our daily tasks we were developing an application that could seamlessly connect to more than 20 online store platforms, take care of shipping process from start until the end and automate internal processes.

There has been a lot of great software written. I enjoyed the internal hackathon where me and a colleague automated a virtual e-commerce shop creation that would automatically connect to sendclouds system through a click of a button. Kubernetes was used to spawn any requested shop on demand in order for customer support to be able to learn more about the shops that SendCloud's customers were dealing with.
